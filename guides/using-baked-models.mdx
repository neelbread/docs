title: "Using Your Baked Model"
description: "Load, chat with, and integrate your baked models in applications"
---

After your bake completes, your model contains the baked behavior in its weights. This guide shows how to use your baked model for inference, chat, and application integration.

<Note>
Completed [your first bake](/guides/single-prompt-bake)? Your trained model is ready to use.
</Note>

## Model Path Format

Baked models are referenced using this path format:

```
[username]/[repo_name]/[bake_name]/[checkpoint_number]
```

**Example:**
```
johndoe/my_repo/my_bake_v1/35
```

**Components:**
- `username` - Your Bread username or team name
- `repo_name` - The repository containing the bake
- `bake_name` - The specific bake configuration
- `checkpoint_number` - Training checkpoint (usually final checkpoint)

<Info>
Find your checkpoint number in the bake output or training logs. The final checkpoint represents the fully trained model.
</Info>

## Using Baked Models for Inference

### API-Based Inference

Use your baked model through the Bread API with OpenAI-compatible endpoints:

```python
import os
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://bapi.bread.com.ai/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ.get('BREAD_API_KEY')}"},
    json={
        "model": "johndoe/yoda_repo/yoda_bake_v1/35",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I master the Force?"}],
        "max_tokens": 1000
    }
)

print(response.json())
```

<Info>
**Key requirements:**
- `BREAD_API_KEY` environment variable must be set
- Update `MODEL_NAME` to your baked model path: `username/repo/bake/checkpoint`
- Base URL: `http://bapi.bread.com.ai/v1/chat/completions`
</Info>

### Streaming Responses

Enable streaming for real-time response generation:

```python
import os
import requests
import json

response = requests.post(
    "http://bapi.bread.com.ai/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ.get('BREAD_API_KEY')}"},
    json={
        "model": "johndoe/yoda_repo/yoda_bake_v1/35",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I want to use the Force"}],
        "stream": True
    },
    stream=True
)

for line in response.iter_lines():
    if line and line.startswith(b"data: "):
        data = line.decode().removeprefix("data: ")
        if data != "[DONE]":
            chunk = json.loads(data)
            content = chunk["choices"][0]["delta"].get("content")
            if content:
                print(content, end="", flush=True)
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Essential Settings

To use your baked model, you need three things:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Your API Key" icon="key">
  </Card>
  <Card title="Our Base URL" icon="globe">
  </Card>
  <Card title="Your Model Path" icon="route">
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Example configuration:**
```python
BREAD_API_KEY = os.environ.get("BREAD_API_KEY")
BASE_URL = "http://bapi.bread.com.ai/v1/chat/completions"
MODEL_NAME = "johndoe/yoda_repo/yoda_bake_v1/35"
```

<Warning>
Always read `BREAD_API_KEY` from environment variables. Never hardcode API keys in your code.
</Warning>

## Common Issues

### Model not found

**Problem:** Model path is incorrect or checkpoint doesn't exist.

**Solution:** 
```python
# Verify bake completed successfully
status = client.bakes.get(bake_name="your_bake_name", repo_name="your_repo_name")
print(f"Status: {status.status}")  # Should be "complete"
```

### Model doesn't exhibit baked behavior

**Problem:** Student prompt wasn't empty or bake didn't complete.

**Solution:**
- Check training completed: `status.status == "complete"`
- Review training logs for convergence (a good loss is ~4e-7)

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test Before Production" icon="vial">
    Always test your baked model thoroughly before deploying to production. Verify it exhibits the expected behavior consistently.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Version Your Models" icon="code-branch">
    Use clear naming: `model_v1`, `model_v2`, etc. Track which version is deployed where.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Behavior" icon="chart-line">
    Log model outputs in production to ensure baked behavior remains consistent over time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep Training Data" icon="database">
    Save stim and rollout outputs. Useful for debugging and iterative improvements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Your Prompts" icon="file-lines">
    Keep records of teacher/student prompts used for each model version. Essential for reproducibility.
  </Accordion>
