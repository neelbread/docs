**Prompt Baking encodes prompt behavior directly into model weights. Fine-tune AI models with the convenience of prompt engineering.**

You shouldn't need a PhD to teach your AI what it needs to know or wait for someone else's model update to give you what you need. With Bread, your model permanently inherits the prompted behavior with zero input tokens at inference time.

<Note>
**The value:** After baking, your model can exhibit prompted behavior with **zero input tokens**. The skills live in the weights, not in runtime prompts.
